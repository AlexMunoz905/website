The MDPfinder package is the implementation of the methods in the following paper.

[1] Junfei Zhao*, Shihua Zhang*#, Ling-Yun Wu, Xiang-Sun Zhang. Efficient methods for identifying 
mutated driver pathways in cancer. Submitted to Bioinformatics. 


The three main functions (LP_matlab.m, GA_mutation.m, GA_mutation_expression.m.) correspond to 
three methods for identifying mutated driver pathers in cancer respectively. 

Please refer the paper for method/algorithm details.
More descriptions about these functions can be found in their annotation part.
