The Nobel prizewinning physicist Enrico Fermi was once asked his opinion of a mathematical model some colleagues had proposed as the solution to an important unsolved physics problem.
The model gave excellent agreement with experiment, but Fermi was skeptical.
He asked how many free parameters could be set in the model.
"Four" was the answer.
Fermi replied: "I remember my friend Johnny von Neumann used to say, with four parameters I can fit an elephant, and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk.".
